Troubleshooting
===============

Connection Issues
-----------------

Make sure you have Gerrit setup correctly with SSH identity key generated and 
host used in the SSH connection string added to known host. Detailed instructions 
are available in the [Gerrit documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/install-quick.html#usersetup).

**Note**: Some builds will still hang in native msysgit mode on Windows due to 
the following issue with the bamboo-git-plugin: [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11096](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11096).
        
You can work around this issue by manually adding your hostname, used in the 
repository configuration, to the msysgit/.ssh/known_hosts file. Example:

> 127.0.0.1 ssh-rsa XXXXB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABBBBgQC699HzXHwr1H6OJeVlRo7h4r+3PY
> d0wNkqzl6EUAeU2iZjqFqQL2ZiNVqs2JrpTNadbgtXBNk9rhQIWajQZG9ZJG/OPxe+NOkbWQVev
> rcELsw5N2wxcJOWz+ey1tFv3VCtNCLUGgF7yIg0kZZVQ+HvAzLoMbiHs0haVmEjnLherSw==

NullPointerException Encountered after Upgrade
----------------------------------------------

If this is an upgrade, and you encouter a NullException when attempting to 
build, you may need to resave your repository settings.Release 1.2.3 changed 
the way the ssh private key is stored for multiple repositories. Resaving 
should resolve this issue.

Unable to Delete Repository
---------------------------

This is an old issue and has been fixed in new releases of Bamboo. Here's the 
[ticket](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-11377).

Debugging
---------

If problems persist, you can turn on debugging in the Administration console to
help resolve and report issues. Steps to turn on debugging:

 * Goto Administration->System->Log Settings
 * Add com.houghtonassociates.bamboo.plugins=DEBUG
 
Check your Bamboo home directory for log output:

Ex: bamboo-home\logs\atlassian-bamboo.log
